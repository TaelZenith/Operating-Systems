The most important function of the operating system to me is its ability to use drivers to interface with other hardware.  Drivers are typically stored as firmware on a device that can be read by the OS when it is connected to tell the OS how to use said device. This is called Plug and Play, and in the event it fails you can typically search for the proper driver on the internet.

Beyond the funtion of interfacing with other hardware via drivers a second significant function of an Operating System is the Graphical User Interface (GUI).  Largely the default for modern operating systems, a GUI allows you to control a pointer or use a touch screen to interact with images to execute functions.

Another function of the operating system is to manage the RAM, or random access memory, of the computer.  The OS controls what programs get access to the memory in what priority and monitors programs to know when it can clear memory, like when you close out a program and move onto something else.  This can only go so far as it is eventually possible to run out of available RAM if the user either has very little RAM physically accessible to the computer, or is using many programs that are demanding.  If the total memory is less than the needed memory, computer preformance can suffer.
