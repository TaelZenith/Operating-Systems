The most important function of the operating system to me is its ability to use drivers to interface with other hardware.  Drivers are typically stored as firmware on a device that can be read by the OS when it is connected to tell the OS how to use said device. This is called Plug and Play, and in the event it fails you can typically search for the proper driver on the internet.
